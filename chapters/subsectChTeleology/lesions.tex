\section{Lesions of the Motor Cortex}

From the very beginning of brain research, the study of natural and artificial injury to the nervous system of animals has remained a critical means to infer neural function. The early studies of Broca localizing the function of articulate language to a specific region in the cerebral hemispheres \cite{Broca1861} established a long tradition of correlating the location of brain injury with a behavioural disorder. In this section we review the main findings derived from behavioural observation of animal and human subjects with different kinds of lesions to the motor cortex, and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods.
