\section{Lesions of the Motor Cortex}

From the very beginning of brain research, the study of natural and artificial injury to the nervous system of animals has remained a critical means to infer neural function. The early studies of Broca localizing the function of articulate language to a specific region in the cerebral hemispheres \cite{Broca1861} established a long tradition of correlating the location of brain injury with a behavioural disorder. In this section we review the main findings derived from behavioural observation of animal and human subjects with different kinds of lesions to the motor cortex, and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods.

\subsection{Permanent Lesions}

The study of the effects of permanent lesions in motor behaviour started with the observation of contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia in human patients with naturally occurring injuries to the cerebral hemispheres \cite{Louis1994}. In humans, a permanent injury to the frontal lobes of the brain by stroke or mechanical means is often followed by weakening or paralysis of the limbs in the side of the body opposite to the lesion. This condition has a tendency to recover partially by itself, especially with training and rehabilitation, but permanent movement deficits in the affected limbs is the common prognosis. Following the discovery of the motor cortex and the Goltz-Ferrier debates, a vast number of studies have systematically explored the effects of different kinds of cortical injury in motor behaviour, not only on naturally occurring human lesions, but using artificially induced lesions in non-human mammals as a way to control for the type, location, and extent of the permanent lesion.

\subsubsection{Techniques}

The original methods used to induce a permanent lesion to the motor cortex were very crude, often involving gross mechanical aggression to the neural tissue by using surgical knife cuts or ablation by water-jet, aspiration, and thermo- or electrocoagulation. These methods are still widely used in lesion studies for their simplicity and bluntness, but have the disadvantage of making it hard to limit the lesion to a single area because of possible damage to subcortical areas or the destruction of fibers of passage. Fibers of passage are nerve fibers passing through the lesioned area which neither originate nor terminate in the region of interest. These limitations made it more difficult to interpret the effects of cortical lesions, and eventually led to the development of new techniques designed to work around such problems. Chemical injections of neurotoxic compounds such as ibotenic acid or kainic acid aim to increase selectivity of the lesion by limiting damage to neural cell bodies in the target area while leaving the fibers of passage intact. Photothrombosis or devascularization by pial stripping aim to reproduce the effects of clinical stroke and avoid extension of the lesion to subcortical areas.

\subsubsection{General Effects on Behaviour}

Widely diverging reports of the severity of effects following motor cortical lesions have been a staple in the field since the Goltz-Ferrier debates. Not only across species, but across individuals and specific lesion techniques, the general effects on behaviour following cortical injury have been a constant point of contention that remains unresolved to this day. Still, the sheer number of experiments available allow us to recognize a number of consistent observations.

\subsubsection{Effects on Fine Movements}

In humans, the most commonly reported effects of motor cortical lesions are weakening or paralysis of the limbs on the side of the body opposite to the lesion followed by loss of the ability to execute fine movements requiring independent control of the hand and digits \cite{Xu2015}. These conditions have a tendency to recover partially, but permanent movement deficits in the affected limbs is the most frequent prognosis \cite{Kwakkel2003}.

Lesion studies in non-human primates proved more controversial \cite{Darling2011}. Ferrier and others initially reported complete and persistent paralysis of the contralateral musculature after circumscribed lesions to the area of cortex that when electrically stimulated evoked movements in the corresponding part of the body \cite{Ferrier1884}. However, soon after Sherrington and others reported observations of dramatic recovery following lesions to the arm area \cite{GrahamBrown1913,Leyton1917}. Furthermore, not only was near complete recovery reported, but the focus of such recovery could not be obviously traced to other brain areas either in the neighbourhood of the lesion or in the corresponding cortex of the opposite hemisphere. This was verified first by stimulation of both the perilesional and contralesional cortex, which failed to evoke movements in the affected limb \cite{Leyton1917}, and by subsequent ablation of both areas. Although the lesion of the intact hemisphere did produce a temporary impairment of the other limb, both of these new lesions failed to reinstate the original deficit \cite{GrahamBrown1913,Leyton1917}.

One of the limitations of early studies was the lack of quantitative assessment of motor function. Later studies introduced new behavioural assays such as the matchbox or dexterity board as a way to more formally test motor recovery \cite{Glees1950,Cole1952}. For example in the dexterity board, monkeys are tasked to pick morsels of food from differently sized round holes placed in a grid as a way to test for prehensile strength and fine digit control. Using such measures it was found that circumscribed lesions of the thumb and index areas produced permanent deficits of weakness and loss of fine movements despite an early recovery period \cite{Glees1950}. The stimulation experiments of Sherrington were also revisited and it was found that motor cortical areas adjacent to the lesion were now able to evoke movements of the impacted digits \cite{Glees1950}. Subsequent removal of these areas reinstated the original motor deficit \cite{Glees1950}.

This deficit in the execution of specific fine movements has been replicated in rats using the skilled reaching task, where animals have to retrieve food pellets placed on top of a pedestal by reaching their paw through a narrow slit. Normal rats will lift and advance the limb through the slit and pronate the paw to grasp the food pellet. After a successful grasp, they will withdraw the limb and supinate the paw for placing the food in the mouth. In rats with unilateral lesions to the forelimb area of the motor cortex this rotatory action of the paw is impaired. If unrestrained, animals will avoid using the limb contralateral to the lesion, even if it was their preferred limb before the intervention. If forced to use the affected limb, they adopt compensatory postures that allow them to retrieve the pellet without having to pronate or supinate the paw, although with a larger number of misses.

Complementary studies have since traced this deficit in both primates and rodents to the direct corticospinal tract that provides a monosynaptic connection from the motor cortex to the spinal cord. Sectioning of the tract is sufficient to reproduce these impairments in both species \cite{Lawrence1968}. While normal monkeys routinely pick up the food by pinching individual bits with their fingers, monkeys with lesions to the hand and arm area of the primary motor cortex are unable to perform this movement, and instead employ coarser compensatory clasping strategies to retrieve the food. Posture is affected \cite{Lashley1924}.
