\section{Stimulation of the Motor Cortex}

Following the success of the early stimulation studies of Fritsch, Hitzig and Ferrier \cite{Fritsch1870,Ferrier1873}, the investigation of motor cortical function by artificial excitation of cortical tissue has become one of the hallmarks of the field. In fact, even today primary motor cortex is still defined by many authors as the area of cortex from which movements can be evoked with the least amount and duration of electrical current stimulation.
