\section{Thesis Outline}

In this work, an attempt to outline a new role for motor cortex is reported. As many previous efforts, it starts with behaviour, and the realization that controlled exposure of animals to a wider range of environments is of absolute necessity to gain insight into the teleology of the system. To this end, we have developed new tools to make it easier to survey a large range of environments while recording as many fine scale measures of behaviour and physiology as possible. These technological developments and methods are described in Chapter \ref{ch:tools}.

In Chapter \ref{ch:behaviour}, a set of behaviour and lesion studies is reported in the rat. These studies had the goal of probing the limits of recovery following extensive cortical lesions by exposing animals to more challenging and dynamic environments. Detailed analysis of the moment by moment behaviour of lesioned animals revealed a number of intriguing observations, the implications of which we discuss in Chapter \ref{ch:conclusions}.
