Motor cortex has 150 years of conflicting history. It was originally defined as the part of cortex where movements can be evoked by low-current stimulation. A map of the body is found to be projected on the cortical surface. A direct monosynaptic projection system, the pyramidal tract, links cortex to motor neurons in contralateral spinal cord. Cytoarchitecture reveals an expansion of corticofugal layer V and a marked decrease in granular layer IV across the excitable zone. Lesions of the motor cortex in humans permanently disrupt the execution of fine movements of the digits and distal forelimb. Recordings of neural activity in motor cortex correlate with movement parameters. These lines of evidence support the idea that this part of the brain directly controls movement.

However, lesions of the motor cortex in non-human animals preserve most of the animal's behaviour repertoire. There are multiple parallel descending pathways to spinal centers via brainstem and other subcortical structures. In most mammals, the pyramidal tract does not target motor neurons in ventral spinal cord. Sectioning of the pyramidal tract in primates is sufficient to recapitulate the primary effects of motor cortical lesion.

An attempt to piece together all the fragmentary and contradictory evidence on motor cortical physiology and structure.
