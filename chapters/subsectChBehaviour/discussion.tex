\section{Discussion}

In this experiment, we assessed the role of motor cortical structures by making targeted lesions to areas responsible for forelimb control \cite{Kawai2015,Otchy2015}. Consistent with previous studies, we did not observe any conspicuous deficits in movement execution for rats with bilateral motor cortex lesions when negotiating a stable environment. Even when exposed to a sequence of unstable obstacles, animals were able to learn an efficient strategy for crossing these more challenging environments, with or without motor cortex. These movement strategies also include a preparatory component that might reflect the state of the world an animal expected to encounter. Surprisingly, these preparatory responses also did not require the presence of motor cortex.

It was only when the environment did not conform to expectation, and demanded a rapid adjustment, that a difference between the lesion and control groups was obvious. Animals with extensive damage to the motor cortex did not deploy a change in strategy. Rather, they halted their progression for several seconds, unable to robustly respond to the new motor challenge. In an ecological setting, such hesitation could easily prove fatal.
